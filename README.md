# Clock Poem

This project presents an English translation of Tahi Saihate's clock poem.
We're used to viewing time as something quantifiable, something you can atomize,
break up, dissect. 12:54 is just 12:53 with another minute added to it, every second
is just counting down to the next. The Clock Poem seeks to change this by giving each
individual second of the day its own unique meaning. Every hour, minute, and second is matched
with an associated phrase. Each moment then becomes its own unique poem, its own unique unit of
meaning.
